## Project Description:
With this project, I am attempting to solve the issue of driving expenditures by finding the most effective driving route for four cities in Southern California. The cities that will be visited are Riverside, Hemet, Moreno Valley, and Perris. Riverside will be the starting and ending location. When it comes to business needs and annual sales goals the amount of time spent on the road can quickly add up making your work day unnecessarily long or making your day less effective and productive. With this program, I am attempting to find the number of paths that can be taken, the shortest path, the lowest cost path, and the longest path.

## Programming Approaches:
The approaches taken in this program are vectors and structures created to define the edges and paths for the cities and routes. It also sorts the order of city names while permuting and combining each route.

### Instructions:
Once the program is running follow the on screen prompts by selecting the numbers 1-5 on the keypad of your computer/tablet to go through the program.
